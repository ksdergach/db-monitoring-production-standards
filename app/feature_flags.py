"""Feature flags via environment variables (#104).

Two ways to use:

1. ``is_enabled("forecast")`` — direct check anywhere in the code:

   .. code-block:: python

      if is_enabled("forecast"):
          run_forecast()

2. ``require_flag("forecast")`` — decorator that 404s a Flask route when
   the flag is off:

   .. code-block:: python

      @api.route("/forecast/<table>")
      @require_flag("forecast")
      def forecast_endpoint(table): ...

   404 (not 503 / 501) on purpose: from the outside, a disabled feature
   should look identical to a never-existed endpoint. Scanners won't
   discover the route, monitoring won't alert on legit 503 spam during
   a planned cut-off.

Why ``os.environ`` and not pydantic-settings? Flags churn faster than the
typed config — every new flag would otherwise need a code change to
register. ``FF_<NAME>`` lookups keep flag additions to one env-var line.

Truthy values (case-insensitive): ``1`` / ``true`` / ``yes`` / ``on``.
Anything else (including empty / missing) — flag is OFF.
