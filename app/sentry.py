"""Sentry initialisation + scrubbing (#103).

Init is **gated on ``SENTRY_DSN``** — empty value means the SDK is never
loaded, so dev/CI never spam the project quota. Production gets the
FlaskIntegration (auto request/response context, breadcrumbs, exception
capture).

Two scrubbing layers stack with the existing #56 ``setLogRecordFactory``:

1. ``scrub_value`` (from ``app.security``) walks the entire event dict
   recursively, rewriting any PostgreSQL/MySQL/ClickHouse DSN found
   inside strings AND any Telegram bot token from #143. Uses a regex
   substitution (not ``urlparse``) so a DSN buried in a source-code
   context line or an exception message is still caught.
2. A keyword-based scrub flips any dict value whose key matches
   ``password`` / ``token`` / ``api_key`` (case-insensitive) to a fixed
   placeholder — protects ``extra={"api_key": "…"}`` patterns.

Both run on every event in ``before_send``.
