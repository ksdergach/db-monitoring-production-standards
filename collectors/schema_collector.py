"""Schema-drift collector — snapshots column lists, diffs against the
previously stored snapshot, and emits ``schema_events`` rows for any
add / remove / type / nullability change.

Idempotent: if the schema hasn't moved, no events are written and the
snapshot is left alone (so ``captured_at`` reflects the last *change*,
not the last poll). The first time we see a table the snapshot is
saved without producing any events — there's no baseline to compare
against, and treating the first observation as "everything was added"
would spam alerts.
